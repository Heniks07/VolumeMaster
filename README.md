# Volume Master
## Introduction 
Volume Master is a project insired by [omriharel/deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) but since I have never done anything in Go I chose to redo everything. 
VolumeMaster can change the volume level of single applications or whole devices with an Arduino and potentiometers. It also has multiple presets to quickly change what application/device the potentiometers are
supossed to controle. To see what each poti does there is a 8x8 LET matrix. What the matrix displays can also be changed according to the selected preset.
